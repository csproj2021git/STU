# STU

STU - Hybrid Classes

Make sure you have already installed:
1) node.js (we'll be using node and npm's package manager).
2) python interpreter, e.g. Anaconda (With windows PATH variable updated with pip and python command locations).

To run the classroom app startalone:

    npm start ./classrooms/server.js

To run all the services together, go to the main directory ```/STU/``` and run the ```run_servers_windows.bat``` or ```run_servers_linux.sh``` depending on your OS.

open localhost:3030 and you are good to go.
