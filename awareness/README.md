# Awareness detection
First, using 'haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml' to check if there is a face or not.  Second, using 'haarcascade_eye_tree_eyeglasses.xml' to check if there is a opened-eye or not. If we get detection for face, but not for eyes - means that the eyes are shut - it's a tired student trust me.
